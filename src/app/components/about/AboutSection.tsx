        <p>
          I&apos;m a fullstack software engineer who loves building immersive,
          scalable web experiences. With a broad range of skills and hands-on
          experience across the stack, I enjoy working closely with users to
          iterate quickly and solve tough problems, no matter the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I&apos;ve developed software for a wide range of
          organizationsâ€”from scrappy startups and ad agencies to large,
          established companies. Lately, I&apos;ve been building products from
          the ground up: talking to users, identifying real problems, and moving
          fast to solve them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of developing software, you&apos;ll usually find me biking
          around Chicago, playing soccer, diving into a video game, or checking
          out new restaurants with my partner.
